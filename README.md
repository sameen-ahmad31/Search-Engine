# Information Retrieval (‘Search Engine’) Program
I developed a document retrieval system using the C programming language. Its main purpose is to search through a collection of documents and determine how relevant they are to a given query. The system performs this task efficiently, ensuring quick responses to users' requests for information.

One of the key features of the system is its ability to evaluate the connection between the query and the content of the documents. This assessment allows the system to filter out irrelevant information and present users with accurate results, saving them time and effort in finding the data they need. The use of C programming was instrumental in creating this sophisticated solution, as it enabled me to optimize the search process and ensure that the system runs smoothly and effectively. Overall, the document retrieval system proves to be a valuable tool for anyone seeking fast and reliable access to relevant information from a vast collection of documents.I developed a document retrieval system using the C programming language.
